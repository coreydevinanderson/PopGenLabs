# PopGenLabs

This is a general (public repository) for several undergraduate laboratories in population genetics with R. These labs were developed for my undergraduate Ecology and Evolution course at Valdosta State University.

There are currently two labs in the repository.

1) M&M drift
2) Microsatellite DNA analysis

* The M&M drift lab is particularly popular with the students, and the R part is more for demonstration.

* The R code for the microsatellite DNA lab was written to replace functionality from other, now defunct, software (from the Excel Microsatellite DNA toolkit and FSTAT). The code is designed to read in uDNA data (in diploid two-column format) and to do basic summaries of allele and genotype frequencies, as well as calculations of the system of mating inbreeding coefficient, including significance testing (via permutation). There are several example data sets in the resources folder.

Each lab has its on README with further details.
