# PopGenLabs

This is a general (public repository) for teaching labs that involve population genetic data, with R or Python. This is really intended for undergraduate laboratories; they should be fun but effective and not overly technical (save the turgid stuff for the graduate students). They do not need to be purely code based, but should have a coding component (either for students to do or for demonstration purposes).

The idea is to share effective teaching labs that others can use or modify. The only stipulation is that, if you modify a lab or (especially) code, you share your innovations with others, in this repository. I welcome collaborators who are also interested in this subject.

The initial seed for this repository is my most popular population genetics lab, involving genetic drift with M&Ms. It is a student favorite and more effective than anything else I have found.
